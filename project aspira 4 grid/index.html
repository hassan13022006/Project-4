                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transformative technologies that are
                    revolutionizing various sectors by automating complex tasks, improving decision-making, and
                    enhancing
                    efficiency. AI refers to the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that
                    we
                    would consider "smart," such as recognizing speech, making decisions, or translating languages.

                <h2>AI (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE)</h2>
                <p>The digital revolution has already changed how people live, work, and communicate. And itâ€™s only just
                    getting started. But the same technologies that have the potential to help billions of people live
                    happier, healthier, and more productive lives are also creating new challenges for citizens and
                    governments around the world. From election meddling to data breaches and cyberattacks, recent
                    events have shown that technology is changing how we think about privacy, national security, and
                    maybe even democracy itself. In this project, we examine challenges in five key areas that will
                    shape the future of the digital age: justice system, impact on democracy, global security and
                    international conflict, the impact of automations and AI on the jobs marketplace, identity, and
                    privacy. Explore provocative and through-provoking topics on how technology impacts our lives</p>
